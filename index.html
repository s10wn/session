            <p>Aro is so much more than an app and box for you phone. It’s about what happens once you put down your phone. Aro lets parents and kids connect by creating an environment where phones aren't a distraction.</p>

                <p>The Aro app gamifies the experience of being off your phone. The app automatically connects to the Aro Home device, measures the time you spend away from your phone, reminds you to take breaks from your phone, shows you data to improve your phone habits, and even lets you connect and compete with others.</p>

                <h1>Creates space from your phone</h1>
                <p>Unlike other solutions designed to reduce screen time, the Aro platform combines an app and a physical device to create distance between you and your phone so you can have quality time without the distraction of your phone.</p>

                <p>We live in a gamified world - badges, streaks, achievements, and filling in that daily ring. Aro gives you credit for the time you spend engaged in real life because the reward builds the habit of putting down your phone.</p>

                <p>We’ve spent years researching, designing, and developing a solution to help both parents and kids. From a beautiful device Mom won’t hate on the kitchen counter to the celebratory GIFs in the app, Aro appeals to the whole family.</p>

                <p>No heavy handed approaches here. Getting rid of your phone or completely locking it away are not practical solutions. We need our phones...but maybe not at the dinner table or during a conversation. We designed Aro to fit in your everyday rhythms.</p>
